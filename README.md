# Sentiment Analysis and Visualization Dashboard using Web scrapping and Powerbi




## Objective

To serve their customers better, businesses need to be aware of their feedback. By collecting and analyzing the customers’ reviews, businesses can know about insightful trends of customers and fine-tune their products and services accordingly.


## Project idea

✧ In this project, pick a product available on any popular e-commerce website and scrape data for that product. 

✧ You have to scrape and analyze the customer feedback and use this scraped data to analyze the customers’ sentiment. Further, you can do the required statistical analysis to draw insightful inferences.

✧ You can go for Beautiful Soup, a Python open-source library for this project. It enables you to crawl the targeted e-commerce website and extract the review from that website with the help of HTML tags.

✧ Experimental data is collected from E-commerce websites with the help of Beautiful soup and the requests library. 

✧ Besides analysis, categorization of reviews will be done by the NLTK model.
